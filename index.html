                    The phenomenon of violence is not a new phenomenon, but recently this phenomenon has occurred more frequently in schools, revealing a more dangerous and serious nature.

There is one fight for every 5,200 students; For every more than 11,000 students, one was forced to drop out of school because of fighting; One in nine schools has students fighting. More worryingly, according to statistics from the Ministry of Public Security, each month there are more than 1,000 teenagers committing crimes. Previously: murderers between the ages of 30 and under 45 accounted for the highest number. Now it is down to 34% compared to 41% of the age group 18 to under 30 (the age group from 14 to under 18 accounts for 17%).
